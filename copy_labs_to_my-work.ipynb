You may work on the notebooks in `sem-prag-2025`, but remember that your changes will be gone the next time you log in â€“ unless you have downloaded a private copy or you have copied over the files to `my-work`.\n",

    "The teacher will create new labs during the course. Not all labs will be available in the beginning. This means that you will probably need to copy over the files from `sem-prag-2025` to `my-work` for every lab session separately. What then happens to previous lab exercises that you have done? Will they be replaced by the standard content from `sem-prag-2025`? Will you lose your previous work in `my-work`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is \"no\". The system will only copy labs that you have not yet copied over. So, if Lab1 already exists in your `my-work` directory, Lab1 will never be touched again by the copying command. Only labs that did not yet exist when you did the copying the previous time will be copied over."
